# DeadHour - Morocco's First Dual-Problem Platform

A revolutionary platform that solves two of Morocco's biggest interconnected problems—business revenue optimization and social discovery—creating exponential value through powerful network effects.

**Project Status:** Market Validation & Investment Readiness

## 1. The Core Concept: A Dual-Problem Platform

DeadHour's innovation is its **dual-problem** approach. We solve two issues simultaneously, creating a virtuous cycle (network effect):

1.  **For Businesses:** We turn their unprofitable "dead hours" into revenue by connecting them with customers.
2.  **For Users:** We help locals and tourists discover authentic experiences through a trusted community.

**How it Works:** Business deals become the content that fuels social discovery. Social discovery provides an engaged audience for the deals. Each side strengthens the other.

## 2. The Execution Plan: De-Risking the Vision

We have a brilliant vision, but a vision without a plan is a liability. We have a clear, actionable plan to de-risk our strategy and validate our assumptions in the real world.

**Our full, tactical plan for the next 60-90 days is detailed in our [Master Execution Plan](docs/14_master_execution_plan.md).**

This plan directly addresses the key risks of any two-sided marketplace:

-   **The "Chicken & Egg" Problem:** Our "Venue Concierge Program" solves this by manually onboarding our first 10-20 venues, guaranteeing a supply of deals to attract our first 100 users.
-   **Market Adoption:** Our 60-Day Validation Sprint is designed to test pricing, cultural fit, and user behavior *before* we scale.
-   **User Experience:** We have redesigned our onboarding to be simple and value-driven, as outlined in our [User Onboarding & UX Flow](docs/16_user_onboarding_and_ux_flow.md).

## 3. The Multi-Role System: Our Competitive Advantage

The core enabler of our dual-problem solution is the **multi-role account system**. This is not just a feature; it is a fundamental part of our competitive moat.

### One Account = Multiple Roles

A single user can have multiple active roles simultaneously:

*   **Consumer Role (Free)** - Browse deals, join community rooms
*   **Business Role (€30/month)** - Post venue deals, manage bookings
*   **Guide Role (€20/month)** - Share local expertise, earn commissions
*   **Premium Role (€15/month)** - Enhanced features across all roles

### Why This is Powerful

**Real-world example:**
*   Ahmed owns a restaurant (**Business Role**) AND is a local tour guide (**Guide Role**).
*   With the same login, he can seamlessly switch between his different personas.

This system allows for powerful **revenue stacking** (a single user generating €65+/month) and creates deep network effects that are difficult for competitors to replicate.
