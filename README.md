# DeadHour - Morocco's Dual-Problem Social Discovery Platform

A revolutionary platform that simultaneously solves business revenue optimization and social discovery, creating exponential value through network effects in Morocco's vibrant market.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**DeadHour** is Morocco's first **dual-problem platform** that creates unprecedented value by solving two interconnected challenges:

1. **Business Revenue Crisis**: 300K+ venues losing 60-70% potential revenue during off-peak hours
2. **Social Discovery Gap**: 38M+ people struggling to find authentic local experiences through trusted connections

**The Innovation**: By solving both problems simultaneously, we create network effects where business deals become community discovery opportunities, making each problem easier to solve through addressing the other.

### 🎯 Market Opportunity
- **Target Market**: 38M population, 300K+ businesses, 17.4M annual tourists
- **Market Size**: $346M+ F&B market growing 7.44% annually
- **Competitive Advantage**: Zero competitors solving both problems simultaneously
- **Timing**: Post-Jumia Food exit leaves 41% market share available for redistribution

### 💡 Dual-Problem Solution
- **For Businesses**: Turn dead hours into revenue with community-driven discovery
- **For Users**: Find authentic experiences through social connections and group deals
- **Network Effects**: Business optimization amplifies social discovery, and vice versa
