# DeadHour - Morocco's First Dual-Problem Platform

A revolutionary platform that solves two of Morocco's biggest interconnected problems—business revenue optimization and social discovery—creating exponential value through powerful network effects.

---

## 1. Core Identity: The Dual-Problem Platform

DeadHour's core identity is a **dual-problem platform**. We are the first platform to simultaneously solve two interconnected problems in local economies:

1.  **Business Revenue Optimization**: We help local businesses (restaurants, cafés, etc.) turn their "dead hours"—unprofitable, off-peak periods—into revenue-generating opportunities.
2.  **Social Discovery**: We help consumers (locals and tourists) discover authentic local experiences through a trusted, community-driven social platform.

### The Network Effects Synergy

The innovation of DeadHour lies in the **synergy** between these two problems. They are not solved in isolation; they amplify each other, creating exponential network effects:

-   Business deals posted during dead hours become authentic **content** for the social discovery platform.
-   An engaged community provides a valuable, targeted **audience** for business deals, making them more effective than traditional advertising.
-   More users attract more businesses, which in turn provide more options and value for users, creating a virtuous cycle of growth.

**Official Project Description**: "DeadHour is Morocco's first dual-problem platform where business deals become community discovery opportunities. We connect businesses needing to fill empty seats with a community of locals and tourists seeking authentic experiences, creating powerful network effects that benefit everyone."

## 2. Canonical Definitions & Data

### 2.1. Terminology: Multi-Role Account System

The flexible account system is a core **enabler** of our dual-problem solution, not the product itself. It allows a single user to participate in the ecosystem in multiple ways, strengthening the network effects.

-   **Official Term**: **Role**. A user has one account and can activate multiple roles.
-   **Deprecated Terms**: ADDON, Capability, Profile. These terms are to be removed from all documentation.

**Available Roles**:
*   **Consumer Role (Default, Free)**: Discover and book deals, participate in community rooms.
*   **Business Role (Subscription)**: For venue owners to post deals, manage their presence, and access analytics.
*   **Guide Role (Subscription)**: For local experts to share knowledge, offer curated experiences, and earn revenue.
*   **Premium Role (Subscription)**: An upgrade for any user, offering enhanced features across all their active roles.

### 2.2. Market Opportunity & Size

These are the official market size figures to be used across all documents.

-   **Total Addressable User Market**: **20M+**
    -   **Urban Locals**: 8M+
    -   **Annual Tourists**: 13M+
-   **Total Addressable Business Market**: **300,000+** venues in Morocco.

### 2.3. Business Model & Pricing

Our business model is diversified, leveraging multiple revenue streams that stem from solving the dual problem.

**Revenue Stream Hierarchy**:
1.  **Primary**: **Transaction Commissions (8-15%)**. A commission is taken on successful bookings made through the platform. This directly aligns our success with business success.
2.  **Secondary**: **Role Subscriptions (SaaS)**. Monthly recurring revenue from users who subscribe to Business, Guide, or Premium roles.
3.  **Tertiary**: **Social Commerce & Advertising**. Sponsored content within community rooms and partnerships with tourism boards.

#### Canonical Pricing Table

| Role / Service | Price (EUR) | Price (MAD, approx.) | Billing Cycle | Target Audience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Role** | €30 / month | 330 MAD / month | Monthly | Venue Owners |
| **Guide Role** | €20 / month | 220 MAD / month | Monthly | Local Experts |
| **Premium Role** | €15 / month | 165 MAD / month | Monthly | Power Users, Tourists |
| **Tourism Premium** | €15-20 / stay | 165-220 MAD | One-time | Tourists |
| **Booking Commission** | 8-15% | 8-15% | Per Transaction | Businesses |

## 3. Technical Vision

### 3.1. Technical Architecture Evolution

DeadHour will follow a phased technical evolution to balance speed-to-market with long-term scalability.

-   **Phase 1: MVP (Flutter + Firebase)**
    -   **Purpose**: Rapidly validate the core dual-problem hypothesis and network effects in the Moroccan market.
    -   **Stack**: Flutter (iOS/Android), Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions).
    -   **Rationale**: Fast development, low initial cost, real-time capabilities perfect for social features.

-   **Phase 2: Production (Flutter + Django)**
    -   **Purpose**: Scale the platform to handle a larger user base, more complex analytics, and international expansion.
    -   **Stack**: Flutter (iOS/Android), Django (Python) Backend, PostgreSQL Database, Redis for caching.
    -   **Rationale**: Greater scalability, powerful backend capabilities, robust data management, and suitability for the AI-powered recommendation engine.

This evolution from Firebase to Django is a planned strategic migration, not a correction.

### 3.2. Morocco Cultural Requirements

The following features are critical for the Morocco market and must be integrated from the MVP stage.

-   **Multi-Language Support**: Full UI support for **Arabic (RTL)**, **French**, and **English**.
-   **Prayer Time Integration**: The platform must be aware of the five daily prayer times (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) and account for them in deal scheduling and notifications.
-   **Ramadan Mode**: A special mode during Ramadan with awareness of Suhoor and Iftar timings for deals and events.
-   **Halal Verification**: A system for filtering and displaying halal-certified venues.
-   **Local Currency**: Moroccan Dirham (MAD) as the primary currency, with EUR support for tourists.
-   **Cultural Calendar**: Awareness of religious holidays (e.g., Eid, Mawlid) and local festivals.
