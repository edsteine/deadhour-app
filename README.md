# DeadHour - Morocco's First Dual-Problem Platform

A revolutionary platform that solves two of Morocco's biggest interconnected problems—business revenue optimization and social discovery—creating exponential value through powerful network effects.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**DeadHour** is Morocco's first **dual-problem platform** that creates unprecedented value by turning business "dead hours" into community discovery opportunities.

1.  **Business Revenue Optimization**: We help 300,000+ local businesses turn their unprofitable off-peak hours into revenue.
2.  **Social Discovery**: We help a market of **20M+ users** (8M+ urban locals and 13M+ annual tourists) discover authentic experiences through a trusted community.

**The Innovation**: A single platform where business deals become social content, and community engagement drives business success. This is enabled by a flexible, multi-role account system that amplifies network effects.

### 🎯 Market Opportunity

-   **Addressable User Market**: 20M+ (8M+ urban locals + 13M+ annual tourists).
-   **Revenue Per User**: Potential for €65+/month through multi-role subscriptions (Business €30 + Guide €20 + Premium €15).
-   **Proven Models**: Inspired by the success of dual-sided platforms like Airbnb and social commerce leaders like Instagram.
-   **Future Roles**: Expansion potential with Driver, Host, Chef, and Photographer roles for €100+/month potential per user.

### 💡 The Dual-Problem Solution

-   **Progressive Enhancement**: Users start with a free **Consumer Role** and can add **Business**, **Guide**, or **Premium Roles** to deepen their participation.
-   **Instagram-Inspired Interface**: A familiar UX for seamless switching between roles.
-   **Cross-Role Amplification**: A business owner with guide expertise can earn more from both roles, strengthening the ecosystem.
-   **Scalable by Design**: The dual-problem model is designed for expansion into new categories and international markets.
