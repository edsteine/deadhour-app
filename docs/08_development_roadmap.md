- Market validation metrics support funding

**Technology Evolution**
```
MVP (Firebase) → Production (Django + PostgreSQL)
├── User data: Export/import user accounts
├── Venue data: Replace fake with real partnerships
├── Analytics: Upgrade from basic to comprehensive
└── Infrastructure: Scale from free tier to enterprise
```

**Team Transition**
- Solo developer becomes technical lead
- MVP codebase serves as reference for production
- Existing market knowledge guides feature prioritization
- Investor funding enables team scaling
