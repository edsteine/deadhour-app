## 🇲🇦 About DeadHour - The Dual-Problem Solution

DeadHour is **Morocco's first dual-problem platform** that simultaneously solves two interconnected challenges, creating exponential network effects:

### **Problem #1 - Business Revenue Crisis** 
Restaurants, cafés, entertainment venues, and wellness centers across Morocco lose massive revenue during off-peak hours (60-70% of operating time generates minimal income). Empty seats = lost money that can never be recovered.

### **Problem #2 - Social Discovery Gap**
People struggle to discover authentic local experiences through trusted social connections. Locals get stuck in routines, tourists fall into tourist traps, and authentic venues remain hidden.

### **The Unified Dual-Problem Solution**
DeadHour creates **network effects** where **business deals become community discovery opportunities**. When businesses post off-peak deals in category-based rooms, they simultaneously solve revenue problems AND help community members discover amazing experiences.

**Core Innovation**: Every feature serves both business optimization AND social discovery, making each problem easier to solve through addressing the other.

### Key Features
