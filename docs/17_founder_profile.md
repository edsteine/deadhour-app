## [Your Name] - Founder & AI Architect

### 1. Personal Statement & Vision

*(This is your space to tell your story. Why are you passionate about this? What is your personal connection to Morocco and this specific problem? What is your long-term vision for DeadHour?)*

**Example:**

"My vision for DeadHour was born from a deep love for Moroccan culture and a frustration with the inefficiencies I saw on both sides of the local economy. I watched my favorite local caf√©s struggle during quiet afternoons, while my tourist friends were overwhelmed, unable to find the authentic experiences they craved. I realized these weren't two separate problems; they were two sides of the same coin. DeadHour is my solution: a platform that uses technology to create a more connected, efficient, and authentic local economy, where technology serves community, not the other way around. I am not just building an app; I am building a bridge between businesses and people, powered by respect for our culture and a passion for innovation."
