## üéØ Common Demo Questions & Responses

### **"How do you prevent fake reviews or community manipulation?"**
*Response:* "We use verified user accounts and track booking history. Community members build reputation over time, and restaurants can report any issues. Our algorithm also detects unusual patterns."

### **"What if restaurants become dependent on discounts?"**
*Response:* "DeadHour is specifically for dead hours - times when restaurants would otherwise have zero revenue. We're not replacing full-price customers, we're filling empty tables that would generate no income."

### **"How is this different from Groupon or other deal sites?"**
*Response:* "Three key differences: 1) Real-time deals during actual slow periods, 2) Community validation instead of algorithmic promotion, 3) Direct restaurant control with immediate posting and booking."

### **"What's your customer acquisition strategy?"**
*Response:* "Community-driven growth. Each satisfied customer becomes an advocate who validates deals for their neighbors. This creates viral growth while maintaining quality and trust."
