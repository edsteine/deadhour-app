# DeadHour - User Onboarding & UX Flow

**Document Purpose:** To define a simplified, intuitive, and value-driven onboarding experience for new DeadHour users. This flow directly addresses feedback that the initial concept was too complex and did not provide immediate clarity on the app's function.

**Guiding Principle:** "Show, Don't Tell." The user must understand what they can *do* with the app within the first 10-20 seconds.

---

## 1. The Core Problem: Confusing Value Proposition

The previous onboarding flow focused too heavily on explaining the abstract "dual-problem platform" and "network effects." This is investor-facing language, not user-facing language.

**The User's Question:** "What's in it for me, right now?"

## 2. The Solution: A Simplified, Benefit-Oriented Flow

We will redesign the onboarding to be brutally simple, focusing on the single most important benefit for the chosen user type.

### 2.1. The New Welcome Screen

This is the very first screen a user sees. It must be visually engaging and immediately communicate value.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│              [App Logo]             │
│              **DeadHour**             │
│                                     │
│   Discover Casablanca's Hidden Gems.│
│      Get Deals. Join the Community. │
│                                     │
│ ----------------------------------- │
│                                     │
│   Are you a...                      │
│                                     │
│   [👤 A Local or Tourist]           │
│                                     │
│   [🏢 A Business Owner]             │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Changes:**
-   No jargon. Simple, powerful language.
-   Immediately segments the user to provide a tailored experience.

### 2.2. Onboarding Flow for Consumers (Locals & Tourists)

**Goal:** Show them they can find great deals at cool, community-vetted places.

**Screen 1: Find Amazing Deals**
-   **Visual:** A dynamic, map-like interface showing deal pins around a neighborhood.
-   **Text:** "Get up to 50% off at top-rated local spots during their 'dead hours'."

**Screen 2: Discover Authentic Places**
-   **Visual:** A mock-up of a community room chat with locals recommending a venue.
-   **Text:** "Find hidden gems recommended by a trusted community of locals, not just tourists."

**Screen 3: Simple Registration**
-   **Action:** A minimal sign-up form (Phone/Email). We can ask for more details later.
-   **Text:** "Join the community. Start discovering."

### 2.3. Onboarding Flow for Business Owners

**Goal:** Show them we can fill their empty tables and connect them with customers.

**Screen 1: Fill Your Empty Seats**
-   **Visual:** An animation showing an empty café at 3 PM transforming into a full one.
-   **Text:** "Turn your quietest hours into your most profitable ones."

**Screen 2: Connect With a Loyal Community**
-   **Visual:** A mock-up of a business analytics dashboard showing customer engagement from the app.
-   **Text:** "Build a loyal following. Our community members are your best customers."

**Screen 3: Simple Business Registration**
-   **Action:** A simple form to claim their venue or add a new one.
-   **Text:** "Start growing your business today."

## 3. The First 10 Seconds: The New Home Screen

The home screen must immediately deliver on the promise of the onboarding.

**For the Consumer:**
-   The screen will immediately show a list or map of **"Deals Happening Now Nearby."**
-   Each deal card will have a "Recommended by the Gueliz Foodies Community" social proof element.
-   The concept of "rooms" will be introduced organically. Instead of a separate, confusing tab, a user will see a "Join the conversation" button on a deal they are interested in.

**For the Business Owner:**
-   The screen will be a simple dashboard with one primary call-to-action: **"Create Your First Dead Hour Deal."**
-   It will show basic stats: "Profile Views Today," "Community Mentions."

---

## 4. Clarifying the "Room" Concept

We will move away from the "Discord-style" presentation of rooms, which can be intimidating to a general audience.

-   **New Framing:** Rooms will be presented as **"Community Deal Boards"** or **"Local Interest Groups."**
-   **Entry Point:** The primary way a user will discover a room is by tapping on a deal. For example, after booking a deal at "Café Atlas," a prompt will ask, "Want to join the 'Gueliz Coffee Lovers' community to get more deals like this?"
-   **UI Change:** The "Rooms" tab in the navigation might be renamed to **"Communities"** or integrated directly into the search/discovery flow.

This revised UX flow ensures that the user understands the immediate value of DeadHour, and is gently introduced to the more advanced community and dual-problem features over time, rather than being overwhelmed upfront.
