# Documentation Roadmap & Future Tasks

This document outlines the remaining recommendations and identified gaps from the `DeadHour_Project_Review_Report.md` (July 25, 2025) that require further attention, execution, and documentation.

---

### **1. Execute and Document Market Validation**

*   **Recommendation:** Execute the detailed market validation roadmap (`11_market_validation_roadmap_MERGED.md`, `13_tactical_validation_execution_guide_MERGED.md`) and **integrate the findings (data, insights, validated assumptions)** directly into the relevant strategic documents (Executive Summary, Market Analysis, Business Strategy, Investor Pitch).
*   **Current Status:** The *plans* for market validation exist, but the *results* (data, insights, validated assumptions) have not been integrated into the strategic documents. This requires external market validation to be performed and its findings to be documented.

### **2. Develop Granular Operational Playbooks**

*   **Recommendation:** Create dedicated documents or sections detailing the "Day 1 to Day 30" cold start strategy, specific sales processes for venue acquisition, and detailed user acquisition funnels.
*   **Current Status:** The need for a detailed "Day 1 to Day 30" playbook is still explicitly listed as a "Validation Needed" item in `11_market_validation_roadmap_MERGED.md`. While `14_master_execution_plan.md` is a general execution plan, it does not yet provide the granular detail required for specific sales processes or user acquisition funnels.

### **3. Address Technical Launch Blockers**

*   **Recommendation:** Prioritize the implementation of the testing framework, real backend integration, and security measures. Document the progress and solutions for these critical areas.
*   **Current Status:** This involves both code implementation and documentation. The *implementation* of these technical solutions (e.g., zero test coverage, mock data only backend, absent security layers) needs to be completed, and then their *resolution and progress* must be documented within the relevant technical documentation files.

### **4. Expand on "How" for Network Effects**

*   **Recommendation:** Some documents could benefit from more explicit "how-to" details on igniting and measuring network effects in practice, especially in the early stages.
*   **Current Status:** This is a qualitative gap. The existing documentation explains the "what" and "why" of network effects, but more practical, actionable guidance on "how" to achieve and measure them in the early stages is needed.

### **5. Version Control and Change Log for Documentation**

*   **Recommendation:** Implement a clear version control system and a change log for the documentation itself, making it easier to track updates and ensure everyone is working from the latest version.
*   **Current Status:** While the project is under Git version control, a dedicated change log for the *documentation itself* and explicit processes for managing documentation versions are not evident.
