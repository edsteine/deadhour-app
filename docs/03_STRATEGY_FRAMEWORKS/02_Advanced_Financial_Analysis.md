## üí∞ Detailed LTV/CAC Analysis

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Methodology

**Traditional LTV Calculation:**

- **Gross Margin:** [%]
- **Monthly Churn Rate:** [%]
- **Simple LTV Formula:** (ARPU √ó Gross Margin) / Monthly Churn Rate
- **Calculated LTV:** $[Amount]

**Cohort-Based LTV Calculation (More Accurate):**

**Step 1: Revenue by Month**
```
Month 1: $[Amount] √ó [Retention %] = $[Revenue]
Month 3: $[Amount] √ó [Retention %] = $[Revenue]
Month 6: $[Amount] √ó [Retention %] = $[Revenue]
Month 12: $[Amount] √ó [Retention %] = $[Revenue]
Month 24: $[Amount] √ó [Retention %] = $[Revenue]
```

**Step 2: Present Value Calculation**
```
Discount Rate: [%] monthly
NPV Month 1: $[Revenue] / (1 + discount rate)^1
NPV Month 3: $[Revenue] / (1 + discount rate)^3
NPV Month 6: $[Revenue] / (1 + discount rate)^6
NPV Month 12: $[Revenue] / (1 + discount rate)^12
NPV Month 24: $[Revenue] / (1 + discount rate)^24
```

**Step 3: Total LTV**
```
Total LTV = Sum of all NPV calculations
Gross LTV = $[Amount]
Net LTV (after costs) = $[Amount]
```
