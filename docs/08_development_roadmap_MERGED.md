# DeadHour - Development Roadmap (MERGED)
## Dual-Problem Platform Implementation Guide

**Source Files**: `/ap/08_development_roadmap.md` + `/docs/08_development_roadmap.md`  
**Merge Focus**: Preserving dual-problem platform concept from ap/ with account flexibility features from docs/  
**Integration Approach**: Dual-problem platform as PRIMARY, account flexibility as SUPPORTING feature  

---

## Executive Overview

**DeadHour Development Mission**: Build Morocco's first dual-problem platform that simultaneously solves business dead hours (60-70% revenue loss) AND social discovery gaps through room-based community deal sharing, enhanced by flexible account management.

**Core Platform Concept**: Business deals become community discovery opportunities in category-based rooms, with one account supporting multiple roles (Consumer + Business + Guide + Premium).

## Addressing Key Gaps (Technical & Strategic)

This roadmap acknowledges the critical gaps identified in the `MISSING_ELEMENTS_COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT.md` and `STRATEGIC_BUSINESS_GAPS_REPORT.md`. The following priorities are integrated into the development phases:

### Phase 1 Priorities (MVP Foundation):
-   **Backend Implementation**: Transition from mock data to a live Firebase backend is the top priority. The MVP cannot be validated without it.
-   **Testing Framework**: Establish a testing framework and aim for >50% coverage for the MVP, focusing on business logic and authentication.
-   **Security Basics**: Implement Firebase Auth and basic security rules for Firestore.
-   **Cold Start Validation**: The initial go-to-market strategy must include a specific plan to acquire the first 10 venues and 100 users.

### Phase 2 Priorities (Network Effects Acceleration):
-   **Full Backend & API**: Complete the build-out of all required backend services.
-   **Comprehensive Testing**: Increase test coverage to >80%.
-   **Payment Integration**: Implement a secure payment gateway for commissions and subscriptions.
-   **Network Effects Measurement**: Build analytics to track the social-to-booking conversion rate and other key network effects KPIs.

### Phase 3 & 4 Priorities (Scaling):
-   **Scalability & Performance**: Begin the planned migration to a Django/PostgreSQL backend for long-term scaling.
-   **Operational Tools**: Develop internal tools for community moderation and customer support.
-   **Legal & Compliance**: Formalize all legal agreements and ensure GDPR compliance for tourist data.
