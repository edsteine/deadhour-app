**Opening (Arabic) - Network Effects Introduction with Cultural Sensitivity**:
```arabic
السلام عليكم، اسمي [اسمك]، أنا أعمل على منصة تكنولوجية جديدة تحل مشكلتين للمقاهي والمطاعم في نفس الوقت: زيادة الإيرادات خلال الساعات الهادئة وبناء مجتمع من الزبائن المتفاعلين الذين يكتشفون أماكن أصيلة. هذا المشروع يربط بين تحسين الأعمال والاكتشاف الاجتماعي من خلال المجتمع المحلي، مع احترام خاص للثقافة المغربية والقيم الإسلامية. هل يمكنني أن أسألك بعض الأسئلة حول تجربتك التجارية؟ سيستغرق الأمر 25 دقيقة فقط.
```

**English Translation**: "Peace be upon you, my name is [your name], I'm working on a new technology platform that solves two problems for cafés and restaurants simultaneously: increasing revenue during quiet hours and building a community of engaged customers who discover authentic places. This project connects business optimization with social discovery through local community, with special respect for Moroccan culture and Islamic values. May I ask you some questions about your business experience? It will only take 25 minutes."

2. **Social Discovery Problem Validation with Community Assessment**:
   - Arabic: "هل يأتي إليك زبائن جدد من خلال توصيات الأصدقاء والمجتمع المحلي؟ كم نسبة هؤلاء الزبائن من إجمالي زبائنك؟ هل تلاحظ أن الزبائن يأتون في مجموعات بناءً على التوصيات؟"

4. **Cultural Integration Validation with Tourism Premium**:
   - Arabic: "هل تعتقد أن ربط السياح الأجانب بالمجتمع المحلي والخبراء الثقافيين يمكن أن يزيد من إيراداتك؟ هل أنت مستعد لدفع 15-20% إضافية للوصول إلى السياح الذين يبحثون عن تجارب أصيلة مع توجيه ثقافي؟"

   - Arabic: "ما رأيك في دفع عمولة 8-12% مقابل جلب زبائن مضمونين خلال الساعات الهادئة بالإضافة إلى بناء مجتمع نشط حول مقهاك يجلب المزيد من الزبائن من خلال التوصيات؟ هل ترى قيمة في هذا المزيج؟"
   - English: "What do you think about paying 8-12% commission in exchange for bringing guaranteed customers during quiet hours plus building an active community around your café that brings more customers through recommendations? Do you see value in this combination?"

6. **Cultural Sensitivity and Islamic Values Integration**:

```french
Bonjour, je m'appelle [votre nom], je travaille sur une nouvelle plateforme technologique qui résout deux problèmes simultanément pour les cafés et restaurants : augmenter les revenus pendant les heures creuses et créer une communauté de clients engagés qui découvrent des lieux authentiques.

   - "Que pensez-vous de payer une commission de 8-12% en échange d'amener des clients garantis pendant les heures creuses plus la construction d'une communauté active autour de votre établissement qui amène plus de clients à travers des recommandations ?

6. **Intégration du tourisme culturel et des valeurs marocaines**:
