## Granular Competitive Research Methodology - Dual-Problem Gap Analysis

   - Research Approach: Order analysis, user reviews, social media presence examination
   - Key Questions: Do they offer off-peak promotions? Any social/community features? Any cultural integration?
   - Dual-Problem Gap: Delivery only, no venue discovery, no social engagement, no cultural bridge
   - Contact Strategy: Customer service inquiry about community features and cultural tourism integration

2. **Jumia Food Morocco - E-commerce Model, Limited Social**:
   - Analysis: Restaurant partnerships, pricing models, user acquisition strategies
   - Social Integration Check: Community features, social sharing capabilities, cultural content
   - Business Model: Pure commission, no community value, no cultural integration for tourism
   - Dual-Problem Gap: No venue discovery, no social community, no cultural authenticity validation

3. **KFC/McDonald's Morocco Apps - Brand-Specific, No Discovery**:
   - Features: Brand loyalty program, deal notifications, individual brand engagement
   - Off-peak Strategy: Time-based promotions analysis (single brand only)
   - Social Elements: Basic sharing, no community formation, no cultural integration
   - Dual-Problem Gap: Single brand, no discovery across venues, no community building

4. **Glovo Morocco - Delivery Platform, No Social Discovery**:
   - Market Position: Areas served, restaurant partnerships, delivery focus only
   - Pricing Strategy: Delivery fees, commission models, no social value creation
   - User Behavior: Peak/off-peak usage patterns (delivery only, no venue experience)

**WhatsApp Business Usage Research - Current Single-Problem Approaches**:

**Restaurant WhatsApp Analysis Method for Dual-Problem Gap Identification**:

2. **Contact Analysis**: How do they use WhatsApp for bookings? (individual only, no community)
3. **Feature Usage**: Catalogs, automated responses, group features (business-to-customer only)
4. **Community Building**: Do they create customer groups? (rare, no cross-venue community)
5. **Marketing Strategy**: How do they promote deals through WhatsApp? (broadcast only, no social discovery)

**Research Script for WhatsApp Business Gap Analysis**:
```
Message to restaurants: "مرحبا، أنا أبحث عن مطعم لحجز طاولة لـ 4 أشخاص. هل تقدمون خصومات خلال الساعات الهادئة؟ هل لديكم مجتمع من الزبائن أو مجموعة للتوصيات؟"
Translation: "Hello, I'm looking for a restaurant to book a table for 4 people. Do you offer discounts during quiet hours? Do you have a customer community or group for recommendations?"
```

**Expected Findings**: Single-problem approach (booking OR communication), no community features, no cross-venue discovery, no cultural integration for tourism.

**TikTok Content Strategy Analysis - Viral Discovery Without Business Value**:
- Food discovery videos in Casablanca (social sharing, no booking integration)
- Restaurant review format and engagement (discovery only, no business revenue help)
- Hashtag performance (#FoodCasablanca, #MoroccoDining - social only, no business optimization)
- Influencer collaboration models (promotion only, no ongoing community building)

**Research Methodology for Gap Validation**:
1. **Content Audit**: 100 recent posts per platform/hashtag (social discovery focus only)
2. **Engagement Analysis**: Likes, comments, shares patterns (no booking conversion tracking)
3. **User Behavior**: How do users discover and share venues? (no integration with business needs)
4. **Influencer Mapping**: Key food influencers in Casablanca market (promotion only, no community building)
5. **Venue Response**: How do venues engage with social discovery? (reactive, not integrated with revenue optimization)
