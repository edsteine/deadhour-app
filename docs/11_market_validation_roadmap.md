**Missing**: Direct primary research with Morocco market participants  

**Impact**: Investor credibility and execution risk mitigation  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Required before investor meetings

### Critical Data Validation Requirements (Based on Competitive Intelligence)

**UNVERIFIED CLAIM REQUIRING PRIMARY VALIDATION**:
- **"60-70% revenue loss during dead hours"**: Competitive intelligence report states this **"could not be verified through available Morocco-specific research"**
- **Validation Method**: Direct restaurant owner surveys + POS data analysis across sample venues
- **Sample Size**: 100+ restaurants across Casablanca, Rabat, Marrakesh  
- **Timeline**: Month 1-2 of validation roadmap (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Critical Impact**: This percentage directly impacts our core value proposition and business case

**WHATSAPP BUSINESS ADOPTION DATA GAP**:
- **Missing Data**: Report notes **"lack of documented case studies or adoption statistics for Morocco specifically"**
- **Validation Method**: Restaurant manager interviews on current WhatsApp usage patterns
- **Focus Areas**: Commission-free ordering, customer communication effectiveness, booking coordination
- **Sample Target**: 50+ restaurants currently using WhatsApp Business
- **Strategic Impact**: Validates our commission-free alternative positioning

### Validated Market Insights (Secondary Research Complete - High Confidence)

**✅ Restaurant Digitalization Gap Confirmed**:
- Only 14.9% of Morocco's 73,305 restaurants have web presence
- 90.7% internet penetration vs low restaurant adoption = verified opportunity
- Geographic concentration: Casablanca (15,281), Marrakesh (10,722), Rabat (9,689)

**✅ Commission Sustainability Crisis Verified**:
- Current platform rates: 15-35% vs restaurant margins: 6-22%
- Jumia Food exit proves unsustainable economics despite 41% market share
- Restaurant owner testimony: platform dependency "like crack cocaine"

**✅ Social Discovery Gap Validated**:
- "No successful social discovery platforms specifically for restaurants have emerged in Morocco or MENA"
- 72% use social media for restaurant discovery vs only 17.1% use delivery apps
- Foursquare City Guide shutdown confirms social discovery demand

**✅ Tourist Digitalization Pressure Confirmed**:
- 17.4 million visitors generating $12.4 billion annually
- 82% of travel sales projected to move online
- TripAdvisor has 2,997,941 Morocco establishment reviews but restaurants can't capture demand  

### 2. Competitive Reality Check
**Current State**: Strong global competitor analysis  
**Missing**: Morocco-specific competitive landscape and user behavior  

**Impact**: Go-to-market strategy accuracy  
**Priority**: HIGH - Affects positioning and pricing  

### 3. Financial Model Validation
**Current State**: Well-structured projections with realistic assumptions  
**Missing**: Real-world pricing validation with actual market participants  

**Impact**: Revenue model credibility and unit economics  
**Priority**: HIGH - Core to investment decision  

### 4. Technical Risk Assessment
**Current State**: Sound architecture choices  
**Missing**: Morocco-specific technical challenges and infrastructure validation  

**Impact**: Development timeline and budget accuracy  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Affects resource planning
