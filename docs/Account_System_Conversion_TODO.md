## 🚀 **PHASE 5: FLUTTER ADDON IMPLEMENTATION**
*Priority: HIGH - ADDON System Code Implementation*

### **Task 5.1: App Routing ADDON Revolution**
**File:** `/lib/routes/app_routes.dart`

**🔥 ADDON Routing Changes Required:**
- [ ] **Lines 17-18**: Replace tourism imports with ADDON system imports
```dart
// REPLACE tourism imports with:
import '../screens/addons/addon_marketplace_screen.dart';
import '../screens/addons/addon_switching_screen.dart';
import '../screens/addons/business_addon_screen.dart';
import '../screens/addons/guide_addon_screen.dart';
import '../screens/addons/premium_addon_screen.dart';
```

- [ ] **Lines 103-115**: Replace tourism routes with ADDON routes
```dart
// REPLACE tourism routes with ADDON system:
GoRoute(
  path: '/addons',
  name: 'addons',
  builder: (context, state) => const AddonMarketplaceScreen(),
  routes: [
    GoRoute(
      path: 'business',
      name: 'business-addon',
      builder: (context, state) => const BusinessAddonScreen(),
