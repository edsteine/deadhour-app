class LocalUser extends User { }
class TouristUser extends User { }
class BusinessUser extends User { }

// NEW: Unified consumer model
class ConsumerUser extends User {
  final UserPreference preference; // 'local' | 'visitor'
  final bool hasPremiumSubscription;
  final List<String> premiumFeatures;
  final DateTime? subscriptionExpiry;
}

class BusinessUser extends User {
  // Unchanged - business functionality remains the same
}

enum UserPreference { local, visitor }
```

**Mock Data Updates:**
```dart
// OLD: Segregated user data
final localUsers = [...];
final touristUsers = [...];

// NEW: Unified consumer data with preferences
final consumerUsers = [
  ConsumerUser(
    name: 'Ahmed El Fassi',
    preference: UserPreference.local,
    hasPremiumSubscription: false,
  ),
  ConsumerUser(
    name: 'Sarah Thompson',
    preference: UserPreference.visitor,
    hasPremiumSubscription: true,
  ),
  // Mix of locals and tourists in same data structure
];

// NEW: Mixed community rooms
final communityRooms = [
  Room(
    name: '#foodie-discoveries-casa',
    members: mixedUserList, // Both locals and tourists
    description: 'Authentic Casablanca food discoveries - locals share secrets, visitors share experiences',
  ),
];
```

## 🎯 **EXECUTION STRATEGY**

### **Recommended Order:**
1. **Start with Phase 1 (Strategic Docs)**: Foundation changes that inform all other updates
2. **Move to Phase 4 (MVP Specs)**: Critical for development guidance
3. **Execute Phase 5 (Flutter Code)**: Technical implementation of changes
4. **Complete Phase 2-3**: Supporting documentation alignment
5. **Finish with Phase 6-7**: Final documentation and validation

### **Time Estimation:**
- **Phase 1-2**: 4-6 hours (Strategic and development docs)
- **Phase 3-4**: 3-4 hours (Market validation and MVP specs)
- **Phase 5**: 5-7 hours (Flutter implementation changes)
- **Phase 6-7**: 2-3 hours (Documentation finalization and testing)
- **Total**: 14-20 hours of focused work

### **Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Zero references to "3 account types" across all documentation
- ✅ Consistent premium subscription revenue model throughout
- ✅ Flutter app builds and runs with 2-account navigation
- ✅ Cultural bridge positioning emphasized in all strategic materials
- ✅ Network effects language updated for mixed community benefits
