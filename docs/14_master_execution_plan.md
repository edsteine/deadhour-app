# DeadHour - Master Execution Plan

**Document Purpose:** To provide a single, actionable playbook for validating the DeadHour dual-problem platform, acquiring the first users and businesses, and mitigating key risks identified during strategic analysis. This is our guide for the next 60-90 days.

---

## 1. Primary Objective: Validate the Dual-Problem Hypothesis

Our core goal is to prove, with real-world data, that our central hypothesis is correct: **solving business dead hours and social discovery simultaneously creates powerful network effects.**

Success is not measured by the number of features built, but by validating these Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Validation:
-   **Social-to-Booking Conversion Rate:** > 15% of bookings must originate from a community room interaction.
-   **Venue Retention Rate:** > 80% of initial businesses must continue after the free concierge period.
-   **Cross-Problem User Engagement:** > 20% of users must engage in *both* booking a deal and interacting in a community room.
-   **Cost Per Acquisition (CAC):** < 150 MAD per user and < 500 MAD per business.

## 2. The "First 100" Bootstrap Strategy (The Cold Start Solution)

This section details our high-touch, manual strategy to overcome the "chicken-and-egg" problem in a single, hyper-local market (e.g., the Gueliz neighborhood in Marrakech).

### 2.1. The Venue Concierge Program (Business Onboarding)

This program is our solution to the "no businesses, no users" dilemma. We will act as a manual concierge service for our first 10-20 venue partners.

**Phase 1: White-Glove Service (Days 1-45)**
-   **Action:** Our dedicated team will personally visit our target venues (from `13_tactical_validation_execution_guide.md`).
-   **Offer:** A 90-day, 100% free trial. We do all the work.
-   **Process:**
    1.  Our team creates the venue's profile, takes professional photos, and writes compelling descriptions.
    2.  Each day, our team will contact the venue manager (via WhatsApp or a quick call) and ask, "What deal can we run for you during your dead hours this afternoon?"
    3.  Our team manually posts the deal to the platform and promotes it in the relevant community rooms.
-   **Goal:** To guarantee a supply of high-quality deals on the platform with zero friction for the business owner.

**Phase 2: Assisted Self-Service (Days 46-90)**
-   **Action:** We begin transitioning successful venue partners to the app.
-   **Process:**
    1.  We sit down with the business owner and show them their analytics dashboard—how many customers and how much revenue our program has generated.
    2.  We walk them through the app and show them how easy it is to post a deal themselves.
    3.  The concierge team remains available for support but encourages the owner to post their own deals.
-   **Goal:** To demonstrate the platform's value and ease of use, preparing them for the paid tier.

**Phase 3: Full Self-Service (Day 91+)**
-   **Action:** Convert the business to a paying customer.
-   **Offer:** A choice between the commission model (8-15%) or the monthly subscription (€30/month).
-   **Goal:** To achieve a >80% conversion rate from the free concierge program to a paid plan, proving the platform's value.

### 2.2. Hyper-Local User Acquisition

Our user acquisition strategy will be surgically focused on the same neighborhood as our concierge-enrolled businesses.

-   **Targeted Social Media Ads:** Run Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns with a 1-2km radius around our partner venues.
    -   **Ad Copy:** "Get 40% off at Café Clock *right now*. See what other locals are saying about it in the Gueliz Foodies community room."
-   **Local Influencer Partnerships:** Collaborate with 2-3 well-respected Casablanca-based food bloggers or influencers to review our partner venues and promote the app.
-   **On-the-Ground Promotion:** Place small flyers or QR codes at our partner venues, offering a bonus for first-time app users.
-   **Community Seeding:** Our team will actively moderate and initiate conversations in the community rooms to create a vibrant, welcoming atmosphere from day one.

## 3. Minimum Viable Ecosystem (MVE)

To validate our hypothesis, we do not need the full app. We need the smallest possible set of features to test the core loop.

**The Core Loop:** A business posts a deal, which is discovered by a user in a community room, leading to a successful booking.

### MVE Feature Set:
-   **For Users:**
    -   Simple email/phone registration.
    -   A view of active deals.
    -   The ability to join a community room.
    -   A basic chat interface for the room.
    -   A simple booking function.
-   **For Businesses (handled by our concierge team initially):**
    -   A backend interface to post deals to specific venues.
    -   A way to view bookings.

**Features to EXCLUDE from the MVE:**
-   The full multi-role system (all users are "consumers" initially).
-   Complex payment integration (bookings are "pay at venue").
-   AI-powered recommendations.
-   Advanced business analytics.
-   In-app role switching.

## 4. The 60-Day Validation Sprint Timeline

-   **Weeks 1-2: Venue Onboarding.**
    -   **Goal:** Sign up the first 10 venues to the Venue Concierge Program.
    -   **Action:** Daily visits to target venues, high-touch relationship building.
-   **Weeks 3-4: User Acquisition & Community Seeding.**
    -   **Goal:** Acquire the first 100-200 active users in the target neighborhood.
    -   **Action:** Launch hyper-local ad campaigns. Manually manage and stimulate the first community rooms.
-   **Weeks 5-8: Test, Measure, Learn.**
    -   **Goal:** Achieve the target KPIs and validate the dual-problem hypothesis.
    -   **Action:** Closely monitor the Social-to-Booking Conversion Rate. Interview active users and businesses to gather qualitative feedback. Iterate on the deal types and community prompts to optimize engagement.

This master plan provides a clear, de-risked path to proving the viability of the DeadHour concept. It directly addresses the most significant challenges and provides a tactical framework for achieving success.
