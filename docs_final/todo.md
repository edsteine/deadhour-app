# DeadHour Investor Docs - Action Plan (Revised Workflow)

This plan has been updated to focus on modifying existing files rather than creating new ones.

---

### Part 1: Identifying Redundant Files

The following files have significant content overlap and should be consolidated:

**Core Pitch Documents (Primary Redundancy):**
- `/docs_final/01_CORE_INVESTOR_DOCS/01_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
- `/docs_final/01_CORE_INVESTOR_DOCS/05_INVESTOR_PRESENTATION.md`
- `/docs_final/04_PRESENTATION_MATERIALS/01_DeadHour_Pitch_Deck.md`

**Other Overlaps:**
- **Financials:** The business model and projections are repeated across the pitch docs and the specific financial files.
- **Problem/Solution:** The core problem statement is repeated in almost every document.

---

### Part 2: The Action Plan (Merging Workflow)

**Objective:** Consolidate all essential information into a single, master pitch deck and then clean up the redundant files.

**Primary File:** We will use **`/docs_final/04_PRESENTATION_MATERIALS/01_DeadHour_Pitch_Deck.md`** as the master file to merge content into.

- [ ] **Step 1: Merge Core Pitch Content**
  - **Action:** Copy any unique, high-impact sections from `01_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` and `05_INVESTOR_PRESENTATION.md` and paste them into the master `01_DeadHour_Pitch_Deck.md`.
  - **Goal:** Ensure the master pitch deck contains all the best pieces of information from the three redundant files.

- [ ] **Step 2: Refine the Master Pitch Deck**
  - **Action:** Edit the entire `01_DeadHour_Pitch_Deck.md` file. Remove duplicate sentences and sections, improve the narrative flow, and ensure it reads like a single, cohesive 12-15 slide presentation.
  - **Goal:** Create the final, investor-ready pitch deck.

- [ ] **Step 3: Incorporate Analysis Feedback into the Master Deck**
  - **Action:** Within the master `01_DeadHour_Pitch_Deck.md`, perform the following edits:
    - **Revise Financials:** Adjust the projections to focus on a single-city launch as the "Base Case".
    - **Strengthen Competition Section:** Add direct competitors (OffPeak, etc.) and clarify your unique community-based advantage.
    - **Refine Go-To-Market:** Rewrite the GTM to be hyper-focused on the "Neighborhood Domination" strategy.
    - **Clarify The Ask:** Tie the $250k funding to specific, measurable milestones for the single-city launch.
  - **Goal:** Address all key weaknesses identified in the initial analysis.

- [ ] **Step 4: Clean Up Redundant Files**
  - **Action:** After the master pitch deck is finalized, delete the following files:
    - `/docs_final/01_CORE_INVESTOR_DOCS/01_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
    - `/docs_final/01_CORE_INVESTOR_DOCS/05_INVESTOR_PRESENTATION.md`
  - **Goal:** Leave a clean folder with a single, authoritative pitch document.
