## Launch Phase 1: Get First Restaurants (Weeks 3-4)

### Restaurant Acquisition Strategy

**Target Profile:**
- Independent restaurants and cafes with 20-60 seats
- Clear slow periods (visible empty tables during off-peak hours)  
- Owner or manager available for quick decision-making
- Already experimenting with promotions or deals

**Daily Outreach Process:**
1. **Visit during slow hours** (2-4pm) when problem is visible
2. **15-minute pitch:** "We help fill your empty tables during slow hours"
3. **Offer free trial:** "Try it free for 30 days, we'll do all the work"
4. **Get commitment:** "Can we start posting deals for you this week?"
5. **Set up immediately:** Take photos, create profile, plan first deal

### Restaurant Pitch Script

**Opening:**
*"Hi, I'm [name] from DeadHour. I noticed you have some empty tables right now - we help restaurants fill seats during slow hours like this. Do you have 5 minutes?"*

**Core Pitch:**
*"Here's how it works: We post your deals during slow hours to customers looking for dining deals right now. You only pay us when we bring you customers. No upfront costs, no monthly fees until you see results. Want to try it free for 30 days?"*

**Handle Objections:**
- *"We're always busy"* → "That's great! What about right now at 3pm? We focus specifically on these slow periods."
- *"We tried Groupon, it didn't work"* → "We're different - we target people looking to eat right now, not months from now."
- *"What's the catch?"* → "No catch. We only make money when you get customers. If it doesn't work, you pay nothing."

**Close:**
*"Can I take some photos and create your first deal to post today? Let's start with something simple like 20% off during 2-4pm."*

## Common Launch Mistakes to Avoid

### Restaurant Acquisition Mistakes
- **Targeting wrong restaurants** - busy places don't need dead hour help
- **Complex value proposition** - keep it simple: "fill empty tables"
- **Too formal approach** - be conversational and helpful
- **Not visiting during slow hours** - they can't see the problem during busy times
- **Asking for too much upfront** - start with simple, free trial

### Customer Acquisition Mistakes  
- **Targeting too broad** - focus on specific neighborhoods first
- **Complex app onboarding** - make signup and first use simple
- **Poor deal quality** - ensure restaurants offer real value
- **Inconsistent experience** - maintain quality across all partners
- **Not responding to feedback** - customer service is critical early on

### Operations Mistakes
- **Scaling too fast** - master one neighborhood before expanding
- **Ignoring restaurant success** - if restaurants don't succeed, customers won't have good experiences
- **Not tracking the right metrics** - focus on retention and satisfaction, not just acquisition
- **Overbuilding features** - keep app simple until you understand user needs
- **Underestimating time required** - restaurant partnerships are relationship-intensive
