## Target Restaurant Selection

### Types of Restaurants to Approach

**High-Priority Targets (Focus here first):**
- **Coffee shops and cafes** with 15-40 seats
- **Casual dining restaurants** with clear slow periods
- **Independent restaurants** (easier decision making)
- **Venues with visible empty tables** during off-peak hours

**Medium-Priority Targets:**
- **Chain restaurants** with local management authority
- **Entertainment venues** (bowling, escape rooms, etc.)
- **Bars and lounges** with afternoon dead periods

### How to Find Target Restaurants

**Research Methods:**
1. **Walk high-restaurant-density neighborhoods** during off-peak hours (2-5pm)
2. **Use Google Maps** to identify clusters of restaurants
3. **Check Yelp/local review sites** for restaurants with timing information
4. **Ask locals** for recommendations of good but underutilized venues

**Target Neighborhoods:**
- Business districts with lunch-focused restaurants
- University areas with student-friendly pricing
- Entertainment districts with afternoon gaps
- Mixed residential/commercial areas

### Target List Template

Create a simple spreadsheet with:
- Restaurant name and address
- Type of cuisine/venue
- Observed slow hours
- Contact person name/title
- Phone number and email
- Visit date and outcome notes

**Target: 30-50 restaurants for initial validation**

## Restaurant Interview Scripts

### Initial Approach (In-Person)

**Opening:**
*"Hi, I'm [your name]. I'm working on a solution to help restaurants fill empty tables during slow hours while helping customers discover great places to eat. Do you have 15 minutes to chat about your business? I think we might be able to help each other."*

### Core Interview Questions

**1. Problem Validation**
- "What are your slowest hours each day?"
- "How many empty tables do you typically have during those hours?"
- "What's your rough estimate of lost revenue during slow periods?"
- "Have you tried any solutions to bring in more customers during off-peak hours?"

**2. Current Solutions**
- "Do you currently offer any deals or promotions during slow times?"
- "How do you usually market to new customers?"
- "What marketing channels work best for you?"
- "What doesn't work well for customer acquisition?"

**3. Solution Interest**
- "What if we could bring you guaranteed customers during your slow hours?"
- "Would you be willing to offer 20-30% discounts to fill those empty tables?"
- "What commission rate would be reasonable for bringing you new customers?" (test 8-12%)
- "Would you pay €30/month for tools to manage this and track results?"

**4. Community Features**
- "Do customers ever come in because friends recommended your restaurant?"
- "Would it be valuable to have customers sharing photos and reviews that bring in more people?"
- "How important is word-of-mouth marketing for your business?"

**5. Next Steps**
- "Would you be interested in a free 30-day trial to test this?"
- "What would you need to see to convince you this could work?"
- "Who else should I talk to about restaurant partnerships in this area?"

### What to Listen For

**Positive Signals:**
- Clear identification of slow hours and revenue loss
- Current attempts to solve the problem (shows they care)
- Interest in trying new customer acquisition methods
- Understanding of word-of-mouth marketing value
- Willingness to discuss specific numbers and terms

**Warning Signs:**
- "We're always busy" (may not be target customer)
- No awareness of slow periods or lost revenue
- Resistance to any commission or subscription fees
- Very happy with current marketing methods
- Not decision maker ("you'd have to talk to the owner")

### Concept Testing Script

**Setup:**
*"I'm going to show you a concept for an app and get your feedback. This is early stage, so please be honest about what you think."*

**Show Concept:**
1. **Explain the basic idea:** "This app helps people find restaurant deals during slow hours"
2. **Show customer flow:** Browse deals → See community recommendations → Book table → Save money
3. **Show restaurant side:** Post deals during slow hours → Get customers → Pay only when successful
4. **Explain community aspect:** Real people sharing experiences and coordinating group visits

**Testing Questions:**
- "What's your first reaction to this concept?"
- "Is this something you would use? Why or why not?"
- "What concerns do you have about using something like this?"
- "What would make this more appealing to you?"
- "How much would you expect to save to make this worth using?"
- "Would you trust restaurant recommendations from other app users?"

### Concept Testing Locations
- Coffee shops (casual environment)
- University areas (young demographic)
- Business districts (professional demographic)
- Restaurant areas (people thinking about dining)

**Target: 15-20 concept testing sessions**

## Practical Execution Tips

### Restaurant Interviews
- **Visit during slow hours** so they can see the problem firsthand
- **Bring a notebook** and take notes during the conversation
- **Dress professionally** but not overly formal
- **Be respectful of their time** - stick to 15-20 minutes
- **Ask for referrals** to other restaurant owners
- **Follow up with thank you** and summary of next steps

### Customer Research
- **Offer small incentives** for survey completion (€5 coffee voucher)
- **Keep surveys short** - people won't complete long surveys
- **Ask open-ended questions** to get deeper insights
- **Test in different locations** to get diverse perspectives
- **Focus on behavior, not opinions** - what do people actually do vs. what they say they'd do

### Concept Testing
- **Keep materials simple** - don't over-design early mockups
- **Let people interact** with materials, don't just present
- **Ask follow-up questions** to understand the "why" behind reactions
- **Test with potential customers AND restaurant owners**
- **Document exact quotes** - specific feedback is more valuable than summaries

## Common Validation Mistakes to Avoid

### Interview Mistakes
- **Leading questions** that guide people to the answer you want
- **Talking too much** instead of listening
- **Not asking about money** - willingness to pay is crucial
- **Only talking to friends** instead of real potential customers
- **Ignoring negative feedback** or trying to convince skeptics

### Survey Mistakes
- **Surveys too long** - people abandon them
- **Asking hypothetical questions** instead of about actual behavior
- **Biased sample** - only reaching certain types of people
- **No follow-up** with respondents who show strong interest
- **Focusing on features** instead of problems and solutions

### Analysis Mistakes
- **Cherry-picking data** that supports your assumptions
- **Small sample sizes** that aren't representative
- **Confirmation bias** - seeing what you want to see
- **Ignoring the business model** validation in favor of product features
- **Not testing willingness to pay** actual money

### Weak Validation Results
**Pivot Considerations:**
1. **Different target market** - perhaps a different city or demographic
2. **Different problem focus** - maybe just deals or just discovery, not both
3. **Different business model** - B2B only, or different revenue streams
4. **Wait and watch** - market may not be ready yet
5. **Stop and try something else** - this may not be a viable opportunity

## Conclusion

Market validation is the critical first step before investing time and money in building DeadHour. This guide provides a practical, step-by-step approach to test core assumptions and validate market demand in any urban market.

The goal is to gather real data from real potential customers and businesses to make informed decisions about product development and market entry. Strong validation gives confidence to proceed; moderate validation shows what needs adjustment; weak validation saves you from building something nobody wants.

**Remember:** Validation is about learning, not proving you're right. Stay open to feedback, ask hard questions, and be honest about what the market tells you. This foundation will make everything else - product development, customer acquisition, investor presentations - much more likely to succeed.

**Success comes from solving real problems for real people who are willing to pay for solutions. Use this guide to discover if DeadHour can be that solution in your target market.**
