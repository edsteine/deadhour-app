- **60-70% of operating hours** have mostly empty tables
- Fixed costs never stop: rent, staff, utilities ($2,000+/day)

### Every Customer's Frustration:
- Want to save money dining out but don't know where
- Hard to discover quality restaurants beyond usual spots
- **No trusted way to find real-time deals** recommended by locals
- Social media shows food but doesn't enable booking

**The Result:** **$300M+ market** of lost revenue from restaurant dead hours meets **8M+ locals** seeking authentic dining deals

**Speaker Notes:** *"This is a universal problem. Whether you're in New York, Austin, London, or Melbourne - restaurants struggle during off-peak hours while customers hunt for deals and new experiences. The economics are brutal: fixed costs never stop, but revenue does."*

## Q&A Preparation Guide

### Frequently Asked Questions & Strategic Responses

**Q: "How do you plan to acquire your first 100 restaurants?"**
**A:** "Direct outreach during slow hours with 90-day free trial. I'll personally visit restaurants between 2-4pm when they're experiencing the problem firsthand. We demonstrate immediate value with clear ROI tracking. Our pilot program includes setup, training, and success measurement."

**Q: "What's your customer acquisition strategy beyond launch?"**
**A:** "Community-driven growth combined with local partnerships. We start with social media to build initial user base, then community recommendations drive organic growth. Cross-promotion with participating restaurants and local influencer partnerships accelerate adoption."

**Q: "How do you compete with OpenTable and established players?"**
**A:** "We don't compete directly - we complement. OpenTable focuses on peak hour reservations when restaurants are busy. We focus specifically on dead hours when they need customers most. It's a different market segment with different needs."

**Q: "What prevents restaurants from just posting deals on social media?"**
**A:** "Social media shows deals but doesn't enable booking, community validation, or ROI tracking. We provide the complete solution: posting, discovery, validation, booking, and analytics. Plus our community specifically seeks restaurant deals vs. general social media noise."

**Q: "What are the biggest risks to the business?"**
**A:** "Primary risks are restaurant adoption speed and customer acquisition costs. We mitigate through free trials, clear ROI demonstration, and community-driven growth that reduces marketing expenses. Our focus on one specific problem - dead hours - makes value proposition clear."

**Q: "What happens if a big tech company copies your approach?"**
**A:** "Our advantages are execution speed, restaurant relationship focus, and community-first approach. Large companies move slowly and prefer broad markets over focused solutions. By the time they recognize the opportunity, we'll have established local market dominance and network effects."
