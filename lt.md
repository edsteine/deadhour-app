app first we gonna like hire people to do the job for the businesses, they will be in touch with busines and keep asing if they want to post this deal and so on, like we do the job at first, because we want them, at first but when app gows they will want us 

we create their profile and stuff and all 
and later on we make them pay 
and for users, ads venus, social media, anythign to pormote the app



read this whole docs to undertand my project and my idea /Users/edsteine/AndroidStudioProjects/deadhour/docs 

 how do you find the app and stuff in it, is it good shall i presuade it also



can you check now if we did all of this fixed about lib folder                       │                                                      │
│    │    /Users/edsteine/AndroidStudioProjects/deadhour/DeadHour_Critical_Code_Fixes_TODO.md  │                                                 │
│    │    /Users/edsteine/AndroidStudioProjects/deadhour/DeadHour_Lib_Code_Review_Report.md                                                      │
│    /Users/edsteine/AndroidStudioProjects/deadhour/docs/development and alwasy after each fix you do or something, you have to do dart analyze 



we should change that the app must be free 
like really free
and never show the premuis or subscibe stuff eveywhere
people don't like it
so we need to make people engage and try app
and feel home
especially in the first months and version of the app
and then after we have users and traffic and stuff we can add those things 


also we should have like a real file structure for mock up
that will make it easy to switch to firebase
and then backend 
using the rigtht depednecies
and depoedncy injection 
and all
don't you think
