## Executive Summary

**Finding:** DeadHour's chicken-and-egg problem has already been solved through a well-designed Venue Concierge Program and strategic execution plan. The challenge is not conceptual but executional - implementing the documented strategy with disciplined focus.

## Problem Analysis

### The Chicken-and-Egg Challenge
Two-sided marketplaces face the fundamental problem: 
- **No businesses** → No users (nothing to discover/book)
- **No users** → No businesses (no customers to serve)

This is particularly acute for DeadHour's dual-problem platform where business deals must drive social discovery while social discovery drives business bookings.

### Market Context Assessment
- **No dual-problem competitors** in Morocco market (validated in competitive analysis)
- **Strong cultural integration moat** through Arabic/French support, prayer times, halal certification
- **High tourist demand** (13M+ annual visitors) for authentic experiences
- **Clear business pain point** (300K+ businesses with dead hours)
