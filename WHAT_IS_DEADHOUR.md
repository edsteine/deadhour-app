# 🎯 What is DeadHour?

## Overview
DeadHour is a **dual-problem platform** that simultaneously solves two interconnected challenges in Morocco's local business ecosystem:

### The Two Problems We Solve

**Problem #1: Business Revenue Crisis**
- All venue types (restaurants, entertainment, wellness, sports, tourism) lose **60-70% of potential revenue** during off-peak hours
- "Dead hours" = empty venues with fixed costs but no customers
- Businesses struggle to attract customers during slow periods

**Problem #2: Social Discovery Gap** 
- People struggle to find authentic local experiences through trusted connections
- Lack of community-driven discovery for local activities
- Difficulty connecting with like-minded people for shared experiences

## The DeadHour Solution

**Core Innovation:** Business deals become community discovery opportunities through our room-based social platform.

### How It Works
1. **Businesses post deals** during their dead hours (3pm coffee specials, Tuesday spa discounts)
2. **Community rooms** organized by categories (🍕 Food, 🎮 Entertainment, 💆 Wellness, 🌍 Tourism, ⚽ Sports, 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family)
3. **Social discovery** - Users find deals through community recommendations and discussions
4. **Network effects** - Each problem becomes easier to solve by addressing the other

### Target Market
- **Primary**: Morocco (38M population, 300K+ businesses, 20M+ potential users)
- **Languages**: Arabic (RTL), French, English
- **Cultural Integration**: Prayer times, Ramadan mode, halal certification, local festivals

## Business Model & Revenue
