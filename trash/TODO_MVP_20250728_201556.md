## Navigation Updates (Latest)
- **Bottom Navigation**: Added Notifications as 4th tab (like Instagram/Facebook) for better user engagement
- **Navigation Order**: Discover → Community → Explore → **Notifications** → Profile  
- **Community Tab**: Fixed double app bar issue - now uses single app bar from main navigation
- **UX Improvement**: Notifications now easily accessible via bottom navigation instead of app bar button only
