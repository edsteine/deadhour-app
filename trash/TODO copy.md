# DeadHour Code Refactoring TODO

## üéØ Target: Keep files under 500 lines (max 800 lines)
**Current Status**: 33 files exceed 500 lines (20% of codebase)

**Strategy**: Start with worst files first, one at a time, divide and conquer approach

## üìã FILE SPLITTING RULES (MANDATORY)

**SAFER BACKUP APPROACH - When refactoring ANY file, follow this exact process:**

1. **Create backup first** - Rename original file to `filename.dart.bak` (e.g., `main_navigation_screen.dart.bak`)
2. **Read entire backup** - Read the whole `.bak` file to understand the complete code
3. **Create new smaller files** - Split the code into multiple smaller files (under 500 lines each)
4. **Import/export properly** - Ensure all imports and exports work between new files
5. **Run linter** - Run `flutter analyze` and fix all errors/warnings
6. **Test thoroughly** - Test all functionality works with the new split files
7. **Keep backup** - Never delete the `.bak` file until confirmed everything works

**CRITICAL RULE: Work on ONE file at a time**
- Complete the entire splitting process for ONE file
- Wait for user approval before moving to the next file
- Never work on multiple files simultaneously
- Always ask "Ready for next file?" before proceeding

**This prevents code loss and ensures safe refactoring with full backup.**
