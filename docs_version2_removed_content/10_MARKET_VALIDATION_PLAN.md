# DeadHour - Market Validation Plan

## Overview

Before launching DeadHour, we need to validate that restaurants have the dead hours problem, customers want deals during those times, and our solution creates value for both sides. This plan outlines simple, practical steps to prove our business model works.

## What We Need to Validate

### Core Assumptions to Test
1. **Restaurants lose significant revenue during off-peak hours**
2. **Restaurant owners will offer deals to fill empty tables**
3. **Customers actively seek dining deals and new experiences**
4. **Community recommendations drive higher booking conversion**
5. **Our pricing model (commissions + subscriptions) is acceptable**

### Success Criteria
- **Restaurant Interest:** 60%+ willing to try our platform
- **Customer Demand:** 70%+ interested in off-peak dining deals
- **Pricing Acceptance:** 75%+ find our rates reasonable
- **Community Value:** 50%+ prefer community-recommended deals

## Key Success Factors

### What Makes Validation Successful
1. **Ask the right questions** - Focus on behavior, not opinions
2. **Talk to real potential customers** - Not friends and family
3. **Test with money** - Gauge willingness to pay, not just interest
4. **Understand the competition** - Know what already exists
5. **Be honest about results** - Don't rationalize weak validation

### Common Validation Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Leading questions** that get the answers you want to hear
2. **Small sample sizes** that aren't representative
3. **Confirmation bias** ignoring negative feedback
4. **Feature focus** instead of problem/solution focus
5. **Perfect timing** assumption without testing urgency

### Signs of Strong Market Validation
- Customers describe the problem unprompted
- Clear willingness to pay for the solution
- Urgency and timeline for needing solution
- Referrals and word-of-mouth interest
- Competitive solutions with unsatisfied users

## Conclusion

Market validation is critical before investing time and money in building DeadHour. This 4-week plan provides a structured approach to test our core assumptions and validate market demand.

The goal isn't to prove we're right - it's to learn what's really needed and build something people actually want. Strong validation gives us confidence to move forward; weak validation saves us from building something nobody needs.

**Success means having clear, data-backed answers to:**
- Do restaurants have the dead hours problem we think they do?
- Will they pay us to solve it?
- Do customers want what we're offering?
- Can we differentiate from existing solutions?
- Is there a viable business model?

With solid validation results, we'll have the foundation for successful product development, customer acquisition, and investor presentations.

**Remember: It's better to discover problems during validation than after launch. This research investment will pay dividends throughout the entire business journey.**
