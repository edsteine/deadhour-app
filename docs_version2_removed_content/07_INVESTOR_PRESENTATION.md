**Universal Restaurant Problem:**
- Restaurants are only busy during peak hours (lunch 12-2pm, dinner 7-9pm)
- 60-70% of operating hours have mostly empty tables
- Fixed costs continue: rent, staff, utilities
- Average restaurant loses $50,000-100,000 annually from empty capacity

**Customer Problem:**
- People want to save money dining out
- Hard to discover new restaurants beyond usual spots
- No easy way to find real-time deals and availability
- Social media shows food but doesn't enable booking

**Speaker Notes:**
*"This is a universal problem. Whether you're in New York, London, or any major city - restaurants struggle during off-peak hours while customers hunt for deals and new experiences. Current solutions don't connect these two needs effectively."*
