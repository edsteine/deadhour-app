## üèóÔ∏è SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Core Principle: One User, Multiple Contexts

```yaml
Master Account:
  - Single email/password login
  - Verified identity (KYC once)
  - Core profile data
  - Payment methods (shared)
  
Contexts (User can have multiple):
  - Personal Context (Consumer) - Always exists
    - Personal bookings
    - Reviews as customer
    - Saved favorites
    
  - Business Contexts (0 to many)
    - Each business is separate
    - Own team members
    - Separate analytics
    - Independent payouts
    
  - Professional Context (0 or 1)
    - Guide/Cultural Ambassador
    - Tour offerings
    - Professional certifications
```

### Database Structure

```dart
// Core User Model
class User {
  String userId;
  String email;
  String phoneNumber;
  bool emailVerified;
  DateTime createdAt;
  
  // Personal Profile (always exists)
  PersonalProfile personalProfile;
  
  // Business Profiles (can have multiple)
  List<BusinessProfile> businessProfiles;
  
  // Professional Profiles
  GuideProfile? guideProfile;
  CulturalAmbassadorProfile? culturalProfile;
  
  // Current Active Context
  ActiveContext currentContext;
  
  // Shared across all contexts
  List<PaymentMethod> paymentMethods;
  NotificationSettings notificationSettings;
  PrivacySettings privacySettings;
}

enum ContextType {
  personal,
  business,
  guide,
  cultural
}

class ActiveContext {
  ContextType type;
  String? contextId; // businessId or guideId if applicable
  String contextName; // "Personal" or "John's Caf√©"
}
```
