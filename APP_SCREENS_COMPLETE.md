- **App Bar**: Dynamic buttons that change based on active tab

**6-Tab Bottom Navigation (Mobile-Optimized):**
```
[Deals] [Venues] [Community] [Explore] [Notifications] [Profile]
   ‚Üë        ‚Üë         ‚Üë          ‚Üë            ‚Üë           ‚Üë
Primary  Locations  Social    Tourism    Engagement   Account
```

**Tab View Architecture:**
- **Tab 1: Deals** - `DealsScreen` (TabBarView content, not standalone screen)
- **Tab 2: Venues** - `VenueDiscoveryScreen` (TabBarView content, not standalone screen)  
- **Tab 3: Community** - `RoomsScreen` (TabBarView content, not standalone screen)
- **Tab 4: Tourism** - `TourismScreen` (TabBarView content, not standalone screen)
- **Tab 5: Notifications** - `NotificationsScreen` (TabBarView content, not standalone screen)

- **Tourism**: Tourism-specific menu (existing)
- **Notifications**: Mark all as read

**Mobile UX Benefits:**

- **Separated Concerns**: Deals and Venues have dedicated tabs (no combined "Discovery")
- **Context-Aware Actions**: App bar buttons adapt to current tab functionality
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Clear single-purpose tabs
- **Performance**: TabBarView architecture vs separate route navigation

## üë§ Guest-First User Experience

```
App Start ‚Üí Splash ‚Üí Onboarding ‚Üí Deals Tab (Guest Mode)
    ‚Üì (only when user tries action requiring authentication)

    ‚Üì (only when user needs specific role permissions)
Context-Driven Role Addition ‚Üí Action Completion
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Consumer Default**: All authenticated users start with Consumer role (free)
- **Progressive Unlocking**: Additional roles (Business, Guide, Premium) added only when needed
- **Reduced Friction**: Authentication triggered only by specific actions that require permissions
