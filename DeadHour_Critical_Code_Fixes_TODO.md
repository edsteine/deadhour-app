## ðŸ“‹ DEVELOPMENT RULES & COMPLIANCE

### Always Follow These Rules (from claude.md):

**Linting Requirements:**
- [ ] Run `dart analyze` after EVERY change
- [ ] Run `dart fix --apply` to auto-fix issues
- [ ] Fix ALL linting errors and warnings before proceeding
- [ ] Never leave linting issues unresolved

**Deprecated API Compliance:**
- [ ] Replace ALL `.withOpacity()` calls with `.withValues(alpha:)`
- [ ] Check for any other deprecated Flutter APIs
- [ ] Use modern Flutter patterns throughout

**Code Style:**
- [ ] Use `camelCase` for variables/functions
- [ ] Use `PascalCase` for classes
- [ ] Use `snake_case` for file names
- [ ] Prefer `StatelessWidget` over `StatefulWidget` when possible
- [ ] Add minimal comments, focus on self-documenting code

**Dual-Problem Focus:**
- [ ] Every feature must support both business optimization AND social discovery
- [ ] All features must support multi-role account system
- [ ] Community integration must feel social through category-based rooms
- [ ] Cross-role features should enhance each other

**Cultural Integration:**
- [ ] All features must respect Morocco cultural requirements
- [ ] Support prayer times, Ramadan mode, halal verification
- [ ] Support Arabic RTL, French, English languages
- [ ] Use Moroccan Dirham (MAD) as primary currency

**Note**: After each major task completion, run full app testing to ensure no regressions. The goal is a polished mockup that accurately demonstrates the dual-problem platform concept with proper multi-role functionality and cultural integration.

**Success Criteria**: App should be investor-demo ready with consistent terminology, working role system, and visible cultural integration features.
